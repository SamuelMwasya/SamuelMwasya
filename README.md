## <img src="https://c.tenor.com/NCRHhqkXrJYAAAAi/programmers-go-internet.gif" width="25">  <b>About Me</b>
As a junior bioinformatician, I am embarking on an exciting journey at the intersection of mathematics/statistics, biology, and computer science. I am particularly fascinated by the incredible potential of computational techniques to unravel the mysteries surrounding Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV).

- 🔭 I’m currently learning & working on `RSV Bioinformatics pipeline` as a `PGD Fellow`.

- 👨‍💻 I’m looking forward to contribute to RSV research and help help solve hum problems.


- 💬 Ask me how I ended up in Bioinformatics from a  Mathematics background 😉.
  
- 🧬💡 In the world of bioinformatics, DNA is our code, and algorithms are our translators.
  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an outdoor enthuasist.
